  profile: "I am an entrepreneur and technologist currently based in Brooklyn, NY.\
  I've started several health tech startups with varying levels of success. i.e. I've learned a tremendous amount about what makes a mediocre product\
  vs. a great product and what makes a mediocre company vs. a great one.\
  <br />\
  <br />\
  I am currently open to new opportunities in many different shapes and sizes.\
  I'm especially interested in the process and signals of early product validation. How to minimize startup product risk by \
  detecting, testing for and uncovering a product that has a high likelihood of success in a given market.\
  <br />\
  <br />\
  Some topics that interest me are: our agricultural future, waste processing, artificial intelligence and the \
  benefits and risks thereof, almost anything DIY, the future of web technology, technological interfaces that don't require us to stare down \
  into our upturned palms, software driven innovation in niche industries.",
